# retrieveImageShack

Script that downloads the Imageshack images of a page that are having the old URL format and put them in a Zip file.
Doesnt work with all images, the ones that cannot be retreived this way will produce empty files on the Zip.

It requires the ZipStream-PHP library from https://github.com/maennchen/ZipStream-PHP and PHP5.3+.
